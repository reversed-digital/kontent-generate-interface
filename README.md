# Kontent interface generator

Kentico Kontent's SDK is nice, but quite heavy for most use cases. We you use the REST API, you want to be able to type the responses.
This little tool parses the content types and add the interfaces for it.

## How to use

Run `PROJECT_ID=MY_PROJECT_ID npx kontent-generate-interface` in the folder you want them to be in.
